ldesc: "Qt is a cross-platform application framework for desktop and 
embedded development. Qt enables programmers to create advanced GUI 
applications once and deploy them to Windows, Mac OS X and Linux without 
rewriting the source code. Companies using Qt can leverage software 
investments made on one platform across many others."
